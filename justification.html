	<p>This is the justification page of the groupwebsite "Shore" developed by Class 6, Group 4 for PRJ4. <br>
		We adapted the following changes according to the feedback for our <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/10db1f15-e0d8-4fae-8090-080ea606aa49-4588/?fullscreen&hints=off" target="_blank" >Prototype</a>.
	</p>
	<h3>Feedback (only constructive points)</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The background image behind the 'why shore' section has very high contrast, so it grabs the attention more than the text in the middle, consider using another image or make it more faded.</li>
		<li>There should be a possibility to order for only one person, since students often eat alone</li>
		<li>The contrast in the "order our plans page" was to dark on some numbers, so they looked already selected</li>
		<li>additionally there should be a contact form for people who have questions</li>
	</ul>
